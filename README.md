# Documentation for Dashboard Page in Next.js Application

## Overview

This dashboard page is designed for a Next.js application utilizing `@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs` for authentication, `prisma` for database operations, and some custom React components. The page handles user authentication, database interactions to fetch or create user data, and displays a list of scenes specific to the authenticated user.

## Components and Libraries

- **@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs/server**: Used for server-side session handling.
- **next/navigation**: Used for redirections within the application.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **ThreeD**: Custom React component for rendering 3D scenes (commented out).
- **prisma**: Prisma Client for handling database operations.
- **@/components/ui/button**: Custom button component.
- **lucide-react**: React icons library.
- **next/link**: Next.js component for client-side transitions.
- **@/components/SceneCard**: Custom component to display a scene.

## Functions

### `getData(params: { email, id, firstName, lastName })`

This asynchronous function interacts with the Prisma client to check if a user exists in the database based on their unique `id`. If the user does not exist, it creates a new user record with the provided details.

**Parameters:**
- `email` (string): User's email address.
- `id` (string): User's unique identifier.
- `firstName` (string): User's first name.
- `lastName` (string): User's last name.

### `Page()`

An asynchronous function component responsible for:
1. Authenticating the user via `getKindeServerSession()`.
2. Redirecting unauthenticated users to the homepage.
3. Fetching or creating user data in the database.
4. Retrieving a list of scenes associated with the authenticated user.
5. Rendering the user interface including a greeting, a link to create new scenes, and a list of existing scenes.

**User Interface:**
- Displays a personalized greeting to the user.
- Provides a link to create new scenes, decorated with a `PlusIcon`.
- Maps over `scenes` to display each scene using the `SceneCard` component.

## Code Snippets

### Redirecting Unauthenticated Users

```javascript
if(!user || !user.id) redirect('/')
```

This line checks if the user object is null or missing an `id`. If either condition is true, it redirects the user to the homepage.

### Creating a New Scene Link

```javascript
<Link className={cn(buttonVariants({size:'sm',}),' w-fit flex justify-center items-center')} href='/scene/new'>
  Create a Scene <PlusIcon/>
</Link>
```

This section of code uses the `Link` component from Next.js for navigation, combined with custom styling and icons to provide a visually appealing button for users to navigate to the scene creation page.

## Best Practices and Recommendations

- **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling for database operations and authentication steps to enhance robustness.
- **Security**: Ensure that user data is handled securely, especially when creating new users or accessing sensitive information.
- **Performance**: Optimize database queries to improve page load times, especially when fetching large sets of scenes.
